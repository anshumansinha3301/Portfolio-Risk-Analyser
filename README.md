# Stock Portfolio Risk Analyzer (Python)

The Stock Portfolio Risk Analyzer is a simple Python project that introduces the fundamentals of portfolio analysis and financial risk management. It provides an educational framework for simulating stock returns, calculating portfolio-level metrics, and exploring how risk and return interact in financial markets. By focusing on core concepts such as expected return, variance, standard deviation, and the Sharpe ratio, the project demonstrates the essential tools used in portfolio theory without requiring external data or complex dependencies.

This project allows users to define a portfolio by specifying assets and their weights, after which it generates synthetic daily returns for each asset. These returns are then aggregated at the portfolio level to compute performance and risk statistics. The expected return gives an estimate of the portfolioâ€™s average performance, while variance and standard deviation measure the degree of volatility. The Sharpe ratio provides insight into how efficiently the portfolio is generating returns relative to its risk. These outputs help learners understand the trade-offs that investors face between maximizing returns and minimizing risk.

The design of the Stock Portfolio Risk Analyzer emphasizes clarity and accessibility. Implemented as a single Python file using only the standard library, it can be easily read, modified, and extended. Users can experiment with different portfolio weights, asset allocations, and numbers of simulated days to observe how results change under varying conditions. This makes the project particularly valuable for students, educators, and developers seeking to build a foundation in quantitative finance and portfolio management.

In addition to its educational purpose, the project can serve as a stepping stone toward more advanced financial applications, such as portfolio optimization, value-at-risk calculations, or real-world data integration. Despite its simplicity, it provides a meaningful introduction to the logic behind financial risk analysis and portfolio evaluation. By bridging theoretical finance concepts with practical implementation, the Stock Portfolio Risk Analyzer encourages experimentation, learning, and contribution, making it an ideal Hacktoberfest project for finance and Python enthusiasts.
